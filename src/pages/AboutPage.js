                        <p>
                            After graduating from the University of Guelph in 2019,
                            I began my career in various support and implementation
                            roles, however, I was quickly promoted and completed my
                            goal of becoming a Junior Developer.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            My primary function
                            was to complete development level support tickets that
                            required debugging and problem-solving a leading
                            Corporate Wellness Software Platform which is used daily
                            by thousands globally. I worked with UI/UX designers to
                            create web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the
                            Corporate marketing website. Other languages I used
                            frequently were jQuery and Kendo tools for
                            client-specific theme development as well as C#,
                            Typescript, and SQL to complete platform bug fixes,
                            change requests, and updates.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Each day I seek to enhance my knowledge of software
                            development by initiating my own projects with
                            enthusiasm and energy. I am known for getting involved,
                            demonstrating leadership, being dependable, and
                            hardworking. My ability to effectively manage my time
                            allows for a balance between professional development,
                            athletics, social life, and volunteering.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            In my free time, I stay very active and continually look
                            for new physical challenges. Currently, I am working
                            towards completing a marathon, look me up on Strava if
                            you would like to follow my progress! I also enjoy
                            backcountry camping, rock climbing, and hiking.
